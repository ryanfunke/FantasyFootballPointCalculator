# FantasyFootballPointCalculator
 This project was created as a submission for a course assignment, CNIT 25501. The original intention for creating the application was to allow users to verify the fantasy scoring of football players by inputting their performance statistics from a game and calculating a total, as errors in applications used to play fantasy football are quite common.  

The driver class in this program is Calculator.java.
